#	MATLAB program that recognizes a person by his/her ECG

================ ex1.m ================

	In ex1.m we observe how the amplitude of the input signal is reduced
more and more as we increase the value of our transfer function's exponte.
	Moreover, as we zoom into the signal we can see how the output signal has
the peaks a little more 'rounded' than the input signal. That's because of 
the convolution with our transfer function that harmonizes the signal.

================ ECG Recognition ================

	Having a database of ECG signals, both filtered and raw, we'll recognize
the person's number by analyzing the ECG.

	The technique used consists in applying a Fourier transformation
on the signal, fetching the most relevant amplitudes returned by the
FFT and its frequency. Then we populate our own database (a 90 lines
matrix, one for each person) as it follows:

	[amplitude frequency amplitude frequency .... ampl freq]	-> spikeNumber * 2 elements
	[amplitude frequency amplitude frequency .... ampl freq]	-> spikeNumber * 2 elements
	[amplitude frequency amplitude frequency .... ampl freq]	-> spikeNumber * 2 elements
	[			.			       ]
DB =	[ 			.			       ]
	[			.			       ]
	[			.			       ]
	[amplitude frequency amplitude frequency .... ampl freq]	-> spikeNumber * 2 elements

	We then apply the same procedure for the signal passed as
parameter in our function 'ecg_function(signal, isRaw)' and
we recognize the person comparing the maximum euclidian distance
between the points of the characteristic vector of the 'signal'
and our database.

	Using this technique, we don't have to compare the 5000 
values that builds the signal, we can actually work with 
only spikeNumber = 2-3 points.

	For raw, noisy signals we first filter them using a 
combination of highpass and lowpass filters (a bandpass).
	For this step I've used the Chebyshev Type II filter
to generate the transfer function H.
